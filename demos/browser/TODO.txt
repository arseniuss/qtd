This is a very coarse port of ./demos/browser from the QT 4.5.1 linux sources.

Done:
- *.cpp and *.h files have been merged into *.d files
- C preprocessor include lines where replaced by import lines.
- const from function headers were removed.
- some '::' and most '->' have been replaced by '.'

Todo:
- imports need to be corrected
- module declarations are probably missing
- what about Q_PROPERTY/Q_UNUSED?
- everything else...
